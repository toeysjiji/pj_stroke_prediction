This project is my self-learning project to learn about Machine Learning.
## About Dataset
### Context
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the world's second biggest cause of death, accounting for around 11% of all deaths.
This dataset is used to forecast if a patient is likely to have a stroke based on input criteria such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.
Each row of data in the table contains pertinent information about the patient.
